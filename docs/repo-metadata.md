## Release Naming Convention

| Item | Convention |
|------|------------|
| Git tag | `v1.4.0` (semver, `v` prefix) |
| `latest` tag | Always points to the most recent release commit |
| GitHub Release title | `GreenFrog v1.4.0` |
| Release body | Paste from `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` |
| Asset names | `greenfrog-v1.4.0-linux.tar.gz`, `greenfrog-v1.4.0-macos.tar.gz`, `greenfrog-v1.4.0-windows.zip` |

Create GitHub Releases for each version. Attach the three platform bundles
plus their checksums file as release assets. This makes them downloadable
from the GitHub Releases API.

## README First-Screen Structure

The README first screen (above the fold on a 1080p display) should convey:

1. Product name + one-line tagline
2. "This is a distribution repo, not source" — brief, not defensive
3. Download table with latest version — immediately actionable
4. Node.js requirement
5. Links to: release notes, all releases, checksums, public key, verify

Current README structure as of v1.4.0:

```
# GreenFrog
tagline + repo-type statement
> note: distribution artifacts, not source code

## Download v1.4.0
download table
node requirement
release notes · all releases · checksums · public key · verify

## Quick Start  (3 steps)
## Verifying Your Download
## How Updates Work
## What This Repository Is  (distribution model summary)
## Why GreenFrog?  (value props)
## Documentation  (table)
## FAQ
## Requirements
```

When updating the README, maintain this order. The download table must stay
above the Quick Start section.

## Pinned Repositories (if applicable)

If the organization profile allows pinning repositories, pin
`greenfrog-distribution` with the description above.

## Branch Protection Recommended Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default branch | `main` |
| Require PR reviews before merging | Recommended for production |
| Require status checks | As applicable |
| Allow force push to `main` | Only for signed release commits |
| `latest` tag | Force-pushable by release automation |

---

## Notes

- The `latest` tag in this repository is not a GitHub Release — it is a git tag
  that always points to the most recent release commit. This is intentional for
  machine-readable `latest.json` consumers.
- Do not set the repository to "private" after publishing signed artifacts —
  the public key and manifests must remain publicly accessible for verification.
- The GitHub release page is secondary; the primary trust mechanism is the
  signed manifests and `public-key.pem`, not the GitHub UI.
